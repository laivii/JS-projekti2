### Why and how the thing works?

This is a project for our Javascript course. 

The assingment was to build an AJAX-application using REST API. We used Finnkino's open source api // https://www.finnkino.fi/xml.

It should be able to do the following:

* Implement a web page, where the user can select a theater from a list
   * We did this with the movie theaters in Helsinki (Itis, Kinopalatsi, Tennispalatsi and Maxim). We hard coded the specific theatres, but you can also fetch them from one of the XML files.
* Select a day between today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow.
* The page then shows the pictures and info of the ongoing movies in the selected theatre, also depending on what day you choose.
* Our webpage displays all the movies from a certain day. It includes the movie name, when the movie starts and what is the duration, the language of the movie, which genre it represents, and a straight link to buy tickets.
