### Why and how the thing works?

This is a project for our Javascript course. 

The assingment was to build an AJAX-application using REST API. We used Finnkino's open source api // https://www.finnkino.fi/xml.

It should be able to do the following:

* Implement a web page, where the user can select a theater from a list
* * We did this with the theaters in Helsinki (Itis, Kinopalatsi, Tennispalatsi and Maxim)
* The page then shows the pictures and info of the ongoing movies in the selected theatre
* Display some other info as well, such as showtimes etc.
* * Our webpage displays all the movies from the certain day. It includes the movie name, when the movie starts and what is the duration, the language of the movie, which genre it represents, and a straight link to buy tickets. 
* Create nice layout and style for the page
* * For this one we used grid-content and bootstrap in each grid-item. 
* Extra points will be given for input field with custom search string. 
* * Unfortunately we didn't have time to build this feature.
